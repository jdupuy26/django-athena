An attempt at a web-driven version of Athena++
The goal of this project is to have
	1) a django-driven webpage that gives a "dev-like" interface for Athena++

# TODO list for tasks in django-athena
1) Create django site that can host an Athena dev interface
2) Create tools for cloning the Athena repo onto this django site
3) Allow for compilation and configuration of the Athena code through the site
	a) Install tools/images so that this can be done within the container
	b) required libs: g++, build-essential, make, fftw, HDF5 (plotting), openmpi,
										gcc4.2 (openmp), see
										https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena-public-version/wiki/Requirements
										for additional requirements
4) Integration with running and plotting through the django site
5) Dockerizing this django page

# TODO 3/10/19
1) Modify pages to only show the Code(s) since that is all that we need
2) Add a button next to each Code that allows for configuration and compilation
3) Use the CreateForm to create configuration, need to figure out how to make modifications
		to that template



Getting started
1) to start you must create a venv in python3, to do this run
python3 -m venv <venv_name>
2) Activate the venv
source <venv_name>/bin/activate # verify python by doing "which python"
3) Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt


# List of Apps
1) athena_code
	a) the athena_code app is designed to host exactly that, the athena code
	b) it will get all the forks of the base athena repo, and then allow you to
		 select which fork you want to use to run your code
